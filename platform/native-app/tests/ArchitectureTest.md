# Native App Architecture Test

Component: `native-app`

VS-MA-12 boundary:

1. This component may implement the permission/dependency status surface for VS-MA-12.
2. It consumes the `check_dependencies` command contract through stable JSON only.
3. It may expose SwiftUI status labels and accessibility identifiers for permissions and dependencies.

VS-MA-13 fake recording boundary:

1. This component may express `start_native_recording` and `stop_recording` through a Swift protocol, deterministic fake client, view model state machine and SwiftUI control.
2. The fake recording boundary exists only for UI/state verification and must not call a real helper, CLI, capture API or processing internals.
3. It may expose stable recording accessibility identifiers for status, start, stop, error and saved-summary regions.
4. It must not implement real capture, ScreenCaptureKit, AVCapture, audio capture, transcription, speaker labeling, external model calls, public normalize audio commands or dependency downloads.

VS-MA-17 read-only transcript review boundary:

1. This component may implement a read-only transcript review consumer for deterministic UI/state verification.
2. It may consume only frozen `transcript.json` fields `id`, `session_id`, `source_artifact_id`, `status`, `segments`, `segment_id`, `start_ms`, `end_ms`, `text` and optional `speaker_label`.
3. It may consume only frozen `speaker_labels.json` fields `session_id`, `labels` and `segment_mapping`.
4. Transcript-only speaker label degradation reason may appear only as fixture/read-model input state, not as a new artifact schema.
5. It may expose stable `ma.transcript.*` accessibility identifiers for heading, summary, segment row, timestamp, text, anonymous speaker label, degradation, empty and missing states.
6. It must not implement transcription generation, speaker generation, copy/export actions, delete actions, processing commands, real capture, external providers, network calls, downloads or helper runtime invocation.
